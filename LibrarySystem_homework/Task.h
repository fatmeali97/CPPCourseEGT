	Implementing a Library Management System
		Note : Including clear and detailed comments is mandatory!

		Task Description :
	Create a C++ program for a simple library management system.
		The program should include classes for  and library members, and demonstrate the use of objects, methods, and pointers.
		Requirements :



		Book Class :
	� Attributes : title(string), author(string), ISBN(string).

			� borrowBook(Book * book) to simulate borrowing a book, which takes a pointer to a Book object.

			Main Function :
	� Create an array of Book objects and an array of Member objects.
		� Demonstrate the borrowing process by having a member borrow a book.
		Use pointers to refer to and manipulate the book and member objects.
		Task Instructions :
