//Polymorphism:
//Implement a function printArea() that takes a pointer to the base class
//Shape as an argument and calls a method area() that should be defined 
//in both derived classes Circle and Rectangle.The area() method should 
//return the area of the shape, assuming Circle has an attribute radius 
//and Rectangle has width and height.
